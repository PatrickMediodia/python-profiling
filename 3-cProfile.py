'''
- Also available in pure python profile but cProfile is preferred since it is more performant
- Deterministic Profiling
    - traces all function calls in your program
    - meant to reflect the fact that all function call, function return, and exception events are monitored, and precise timings are made for the intervals between these events (during which time the userâ€™s code is executing). 
- Statistical Profiling - randomly samples the effective instruction pointer, and deduces where time is being spent. The latter technique traditionally involves less overhead (as the code does not need to be instrumented), but provides only relative indications of where time is being spent

- primitive means non-recursive calls
- pStats help format, sort, and print the collected runtime statistics
- most of the recursive calls are redundant because they keep calculating the same values (use memoization)
- profiling adds noticeable runtime overhead due to keeping track of certain events. This may be a problem in systems have already have poor performance
